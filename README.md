# Duman AI Newsletter

There was a clear lack of up-to-date content in Persian for disseminating the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and robotics. 
Most of the available content was low-quality clickbait, lacking technical depth. 
To address this gap, I launched a dedicated news channel to provide Persian-speaking audiences with the latest developments in the field.

Initially, I started with an email newsletter, but it didn't attract a significant audience. 
In parallel, I launched a website and a Telegram channel. 
Eventually, I discontinued the email and website updates, while the Telegram channel continues to be actively maintained and regularly updated.

For technical topics and educational content,
I use GitHub as the primary platform. 
I deploy the generated content in HTML format to make it accessible and structured for the audience.

At the moment all the contents are in Persian.
